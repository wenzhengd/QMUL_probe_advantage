## P0（必须改）
- [ ] 1. In Sec-II-B (Quantum probe: open quantum system-based learning and algebraic structure), the the probe is labeled as $Q$ and matter as $E$. You should change $Q$ to $P$ and $E$ to $M$, in all the equations therein, the subscript Q&E should also be updated accordingly. 
- [ ] 2. In the full main.tex, the operator on matter is labelled as $B$ (this include $B_0$, $B(t)$), it should be upated as $M$ (and $M_0$, $M(t)$  accordingly). 
- [ ] 3. In Sec-II-B, some subsript is $q$ (or $\vec{q}$ etc), change ALL of them to $p$ (and correspondance) as $p$. 
- [ ] 4. Math expressions of correlators appear many places file as $S(\omega)$ or $C_{\pm}$; these should be unified to a new convention: $S(\omega)$ -> $\mathcal{M}^+$, and $C_{\pm}$ -> $\mathcal{M}^{\pm}$. 
- [ ] 5. Remove the ``boxes'' of equations. In Sec-VI, the kernel operator is labelled as $\mathcal{M}$ (and its tilde), this is notation conflict with previous context. You should change these in such section to be $\mathcal{K}$ (and its tilde) as kernel.
