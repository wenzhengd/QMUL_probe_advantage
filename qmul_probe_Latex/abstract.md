# Quantum probe advantage of learning many-body systems <!---->
Understanding which physical properties of a quantum many-body system are operationally accessible is a foundational question underlying spectroscopy, thermodynamics, and quantum information science.
Conventional response theory, a cornerstone of many-body physics, perturbs and measures the system itself, yielding susceptibilities constructed exclusively from causally ordered nested commutators.
Here we establish, at the operator level and from first principles, that when an auxiliary quantum probe is coherently coupled to a target system and subsequently measured, its reduced dynamics encodes a strictly larger class of information about the system. 
Owing to probe--system entanglement and the resulting non-Markovian backaction, probe observables access multi-time anti-commutator correlators and mixed operator orderings that characterize fluctuations, non-equilibriant behavior, and irreversibility---quantities that are not, in general, determined by response functions alone. We present explicit examples showing how small, controllable quantum probes can efficiently reconstruct physical properties of many-body systems that are otherwise inaccessible or operationally impractical using system-only measurements. 
Our results demonstrate that quantum probes do not merely enhance measurement sensitivity within a closed-system framework, but fundamentally enlarge the algebra of operationally measurable observables, thereby establishing a precise and general notion of quantum probe advantage in many-body physics.
